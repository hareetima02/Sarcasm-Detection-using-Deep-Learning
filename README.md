#  Sarcasm Detection Using NLP   


## 🌈 What’s This About?  
Sarcasm can be hilariously witty or incredibly confusing—especially for machines! This project equips computers to detect sarcasm in text, transforming ambiguity into clarity. Think of it as giving machines their very own sarcasm radar! 🛠️

## 🚀 **Why Do We Need This?**  
Imagine these scenarios:  
- A customer writes, *"Great service, would definitely recommend waiting 2 hours for a coffee!"* ☕. Is that sarcasm? Probably!  
- Social media is a hub for *"oh-so-funny"* sarcastic comments. Understanding context is key to effective content moderation and sentiment analysis.  

This project steps in to decode sarcasm with **machine learning** and **natural language processing** magic! 🪄

## 🛠️ **How It Works!**  
Here’s the behind-the-scenes toolkit of awesomeness that powers this project:

### **1️⃣ Dataset Preparation**  
We split our data into three parts:  
- **Training Set** 🏋️‍♀️: Teaches the model to spot patterns.  
- **Validation Set** 🧐: Fine-tunes its judgment.  
- **Test Set** 🔍: Evaluates its wit detection skills!  

### **2️⃣ Feature Extraction with Word Embeddings**  
Using **GloVe**, we converted plain words into their mathematical essence (vectors) 🌌, enabling the model to grasp semantic nuances and context.  

### **3️⃣ Model Architecture: LSTM**  
Our star performer is **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**—a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) with memory superpowers. It processes sentences like a human would, remembering the past and predicting the future! 🧠✨  

### **4️⃣ Training & Evaluation**  
Metrics we’re obsessed with:  
- **Accuracy:** Overall success rate of detecting sarcasm.  
- **Precision:** How sharp we are in identifying sarcasm.  
- **Recall:** Ensuring no sarcastic comment escapes detection.  

Current stats? **78% accuracy**, with a **30% reduction in false positives**! 🎯

## 💡 **Tech Stack**  
- 🐍 **Python**: The engine of creativity.  
- 💼 **NLP Libraries**: Hugging Face, NLTK, or SpaCy (as per the notebook).  
- 🔢 **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow/Keras for deep learning.  
- 📊 **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib & Seaborn for insights.

## 🌟 **Key Features**  
- 🧠 Detects sarcasm in diverse textual data.  
- 🌍 Language-agnostic potential with the right embeddings!  
- 🚀 Ready for integration into sentiment analysis pipelines, chatbots, or content moderation systems.
